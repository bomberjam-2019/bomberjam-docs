Welcome to the Bomberjam .NET Starter, which uses decision tree based algorithms by default.

## Where to code?

You'll find many `TODO` comments in the code to help you understand what to change.

### 1. Prerequisites

Having a local Bomberjam server running on your computer. Follow the installation steps in the Overview page.

### 2. TODO-Setup: 

`// TODO-Setup` comments need to be addressed in order to have your code working.

**TODO-Setup-1**: Set the path of unzipped gamelog files (saved games)

**TODO-Setup-2**: Choose if the program must train a model or play a game in the browser.

### 3. TODO-Main: Extract features

That's where you're going to spend most of your time as feature-engineering is the biggest challenge in machine learning.

**TODO-Main-2**: Utility functions

Basic implementation has been provided, but it has flaws. It's up to you to modify them or create more specialized functions ;)

### 4. TODO-Extra: Go further

Potential leads to explore in order to get extra advantages.
